# FreeCodeCamp Challenge - Use the Twitchtv JSON API

1. Objective: Build a **CodePen.io** app that is functionally similar to this: **[https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/)**.

2. Fulfill the below **user stories**. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
3. User Story: I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
4 .User Story: I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.
5. User Story: if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.
6. Hint: See an example call to Twitch.tv's JSONP API at http://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/use-the-twitchtv-json-api/19541.
7. Hint: The relevant documentation about this API call is here: https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/v5/reference/streams/#get-stream-by-user.
8. Hint: Here's an array of the Twitch.tv usernames of people who regularly stream: `["ESL_SC2", "OgamingSC2", "cretetion", "freecodecamp", "storbeck", "habathcx", "RobotCaleb", "noobs2ninjas"]`.
9. UPDATE: Due to a change in conditions on API usage explained here Twitch.tv now requires an API key, but we've built a workaround. Use https://wind-bow.glitch.me/twitch-api instead of twitch's API base URL (i.e. https://api.twitch.tv/kraken ) and you'll still be able to get account information, without needing to sign up for an API key.
10. Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.
11. When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.
12. You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
